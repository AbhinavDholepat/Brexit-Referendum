# Brexit-Referendum
Using Simple Poll Aggregation, this report will will attempt to predict the result of the Brexit Referendum one day before the referendum  

The analysis uses poll aggregation of crediable pollsters from a week before the election. 
By conducting poll aggregation we treat 11 polls as a single poll with a mean spread and a 95% Confidence Interval. 
We then predict the Referendum result as though we were one day before the actual vote took place. 
Separately, we treat each poll as part of a based of polls and check if our prediction matches.
